### Flash the board

The board is flashed using its on-board UF2 boot loader.

The boot loader will present a mass storage device that has to be mounted to
/media/CPLAYBTBOOT so `uf2conv.py` can find it. If you have an auto-mounter
installed this will happen automatically.

The rest of the process is automated in the usual `make flash` target.

If RIOT is already running on the board, it will automatically reset the CPU
and enter the bootloader.

If some other firmware is running or RIOT crashed, you need to enter the
bootloader manually by pressing the board's reset button twice within half a
second.

Readiness of the bootloader is indicated by the RED led continuously fading
in/out.

### Accessing STDIO

The usual way to obtain a console on this board is using an emulated USB serial
port (CDC-ACM).  This is available automatically using the `stdio_cdc_acm`
module, unless any other stdio module is enabled.

On Linux systems with ModemManager < 1.10 installed, `make term` will, in some
setups, fail for a few seconds after the device has come up.  This is [fixed in
its 1.12.4 version](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mobile-broadband/ModemManager/issues/164),
but should not be more than a short annoyance in earlier versions.

To ease debugging, pins 0.30 and 0.14 are configured as RX and TX,
respectively.  They provide stdio if no CDC-ACM is disabled, and can be used as
a custom UART otherwise.
